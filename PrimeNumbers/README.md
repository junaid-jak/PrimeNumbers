# Prime Numbers Program

This is a simple Java program that prints prime numbers up to a specified limit (50 in this case). 
The program uses an optimized approach to check for prime numbers by only testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.

## Features:
- Uses a labeled `continue` to skip non-prime numbers.
- Optimized by checking divisibility up to the square root of each number.
- No boolean flag needed to track primality.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `Primes.java` file to see the output of prime numbers up to 50.

## Technologies Used:
